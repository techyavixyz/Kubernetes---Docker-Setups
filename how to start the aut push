Run the Auto-Commit Script: Now that you're in the correct directory, run your auto-commit.js script:

bash
Copy code
node .git/hooks/auto-commit.js



Step-by-Step Setup
Initialize Git Repository: If you haven't already, open your project folder in VS Code and initialize a Git repository:

bash
Copy code
git init
Create a Git Hook: Git hooks are scripts that run automatically at certain points in the Git workflow. You can create a post-commit hook to automatically push changes after a commit.

Navigate to your .git/hooks directory:

bash
Copy code
cd .git/hooks
Create a new file named post-commit:

bash
Copy code
touch post-commit
Open post-commit in VS Code and add the following script:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/sh
git push origin main  # Change 'main' to your default branch if different
Make the script executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x post-commit
Set Up Auto-Commit: You can use a file watcher to automatically commit changes. One popular tool for this is nodemon, but there are many other options available.

Install nodemon globally if you don't have it:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g nodemon



make sure the package should be installed 

npm and nodejs


then install npm install chokidar
